                    <h2>What Can I Expect?  The Best.</h2>
                    <p>The first step in building your privacy fence is the standard 24" hole. We take the time to properly bury every 4" x 4" x 8' pressure treated post a complete 24 inches deep. Each hole gets at least 60 pounds of concrete shoes.</p>
                    <p>Each post gets screwed up by 3" exterior screws that hold up 2" x 4" x 8' pressure treated rails. 3 of them. All rails are then nailed by 2" galvanized nails that provide a tight grip on a row of 6' Dog Ear Pickets.</p>

                    <h3 style="padding-top:20px;text-align: left;">How We Prepare Your Quote</h3>


                    <p>We will probe the ground to determine how much (not if) rock is under your yard. There will most likely be some (or lots) of jack hammering involved.  It's all good.  We will quote <u>most</u> jobs at $15 per linear foot plus $100 for every 4 foot wide gate that needs to be built.</p>
                    <p>If you like our quote and are HOA and City/County approved, we get started on your fence in a first come, first serve manner.  Privacy Fencemen is a partnership of 3 people, so we can tell you where we are progress-wise on other jobs, and a reasonable expectation of when your privacy fence will be started and completed.</p>

                    <p>When you contract us you will receive a receipt for paying us cash or chek (made payable to "Privacy Fencemen") for the equivalent of half the agreed upon quote. The remaining balance on the contract is due upon completion of the fence.</p>
